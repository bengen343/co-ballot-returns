## About <a name = "about"></a>

The Colorado Secreatry of State's office makes available near realtime updates on _who_ (not for whom) has voted in each election during the one month leading up to Election Day when voters can return mail-in ballots.

This repository creates a Google Cloud Run service that can be run on a schedule or on demand to retrieve the Secretary of State data, upload it your Google BigQuery instance, and perform basic analysis in the form of calculating crosstabs on ballot returns and turnout for various demographic groups and geographies.

The output of this repository is typically available for exploration during each election on our webpage at http://www.ConstellationPolitical.com

In our configuration this repository is built by Google Cloud Build on a push to this GitHub repository and then executed as a Google Cloud Run Job.


## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get your copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

This repository depends on certain user defined variables that need to be configured in two places: `config.py` & `.env`

`config.py` will generally contain the latest values that I am using to run this repository. A careful read and update to your own values should be all that's needed to update this file. The variables contained here are mostly file and project names.

This repository includes a template for `.env` as the file `.env.template`. If you are attempting to run this repository locally and not as a Google Cloud Run service you will need to modify `.env.template` to contain your secret variables such as the strings for your Secretary of State ftp user name and password as well as your Google Service Account credentials. Once you have done so, save  `.env.template` as `.env`


### Prerequisites

This repository is meant to be run as a Google Cloud Run service. That means you will need your own Google Cloud login and several Google Cloud services enabled.

1.  Google Cloud Run
2.  Google Big Query
3.  Google Cloud Storage
4.  Google Cloud Scheduler

This repository uses the current version of the Colorado voter file augmented with additional demographic information by Constellation. It downloads this information from our Google BigQuery. If you do not have your own voter file in BigQuery it won't work. You can request access to ours (for a hefty fee) by reaching out to me at Ben@ConstellationPolitical.com.

Last, but not least, you need to have your own authorization and credentials to connect to the Colorado Secreatary of State's FTP service to download voter data.

Unfortunately, this means this repository will only serve demonstrative purposes for most users.

### Installing

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/bengen343/co-ballot-returns.git
```

2. Update variables within `config.py` to name your outputs and correctly reference file origins/destinations. 

3. Update `.env.template` with values for each of the variables requested. Note that the variable `BQ_ACCOUNT_CREDS` should be the entire output of the json credential file associated with the Google service account you're using for this project. Save this file as `.env` when you've added all your values.

4. Create a virtual environment for the repository, probably by running `python -m venv .venv` in the terminal from the local directory. 

5. Activate the virtual environment, probably by running `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat` on Windows or `source .venv/bin/activate` on Mac.

6. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
